# Markdown Diagrams <small>(browser extension)</small>

This is a copy from https://github.com/marcozaccari/markdown-diagrams-browser-extension.

I found that the source extension can't render plantuml codes that don't contain `@startuml` and `@enduml`.  I don't want to write them.

Render codes to diagrams in websites and suit everyone will bring much boring complexity, so I decide to fork the origin repository and keep a copy.
